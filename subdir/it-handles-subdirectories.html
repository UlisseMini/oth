<p>This might seem trivial, but having the stylesheet be <code>/styles.css</code> doesn't work on github pages, since it tries to fetch <code>username.github.io/styles.css</code> instead of <code>username.github.io/repo/styles.css</code>.</p>
<p>I solve this by making all stylesheet links relative. Since I don't want the user to have to configure their repo root (I could probably get it from a variable in actions, but that's cursed)</p>
