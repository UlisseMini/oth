<p>This might seem trivial, but having the stylesheet be <code>/styles.css</code> doesn't work on github pages, since it tries to fetch <code>username.github.io/styles.css</code> instead of <code>username.github.io/repo/styles.css</code>.</p>
<p>I solve this by making all stylesheet links relative. Since I don't want the user to have to configure their repo root (I could probably get it from a variable in actions, but that's cursed)</p>
<p>Links also work, see <a class="internal new" href="./another">./Another</a> or return to <a class="internal new" href="..">The homepage</a></p>
