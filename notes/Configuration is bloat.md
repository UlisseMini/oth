The most flexible form of configuration is programming. We should not force programmers to learn apis etc for simple things. Just clone the code that does almost what you want and change it!

[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) does this, though modifying it is relatively difficult compared to [oth](https://github.com/UlisseMini/oth).
